FAQ:
Why are there so many commits? 
- because i tested in production without never touching redis or a proper node app. and without configuring heroku cli.

I used some guides. heres one i remembered to save:
- https://levelup.gitconnected.com/render-dynamic-content-in-nodejs-using-templates-a58cae681148

todo:
- neko api
- friend data
- discord bot
- anime.js

Env details:
This runs on heroku. It is configured to auto deploy on updates to the repo.
