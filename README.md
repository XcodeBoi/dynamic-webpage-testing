This is part of my highschool web development class 

I wouldn't recommend using this code for anything other than stalking my terribly uninformed programming

I followed these guides:
- https://levelup.gitconnected.com/render-dynamic-content-in-nodejs-using-templates-a58cae681148
- https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mysql.asp

todo:
- neko api
- friend data
- discord bot
